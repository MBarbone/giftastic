GifTastic

Overview
Working with Giphy API and AJAX.

Summary
I chose to make a giphy generator about one of the things I find most fascinating- animals! The webpage will automatically load a number of already made buttons of just a few of the world's exotic wildlife. When a button is clicked, 10 of the most relevant gifs will populate below. You can animate the gif by simply clicking on an image.

Your favorite animal is not displayed? You can make your own button with your favorite animal by inputing it in the input panel on the top left. The new animal button will populate within the array of buttons.

Enjoy!
